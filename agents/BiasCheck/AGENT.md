# BiasCheck

*Ported from LifeOS `skills/BiasCheck/` (v1.0.3).*

Runs a three-layer bias audit on any source — a URL, a file path, or
raw text. It fetches the content plus any study it cites, then checks
(1) biases inside the data, (2) conflicts of interest in the source
organization, and (3) distortions the journalism added on top. The
output separates what the data actually supports from what got
editorialized.

## The Problem

Most "this is biased" arguments are vibes — a feeling about a source,
with nothing concrete underneath. They're not repeatable and they
don't tell you where the distortion lives. The other failure is
analyzing an article without ever reaching the study it cites, so you
critique the headline and never see that the underlying data was fine
(or that it was junk). A fixed taxonomy and a fixed output shape fix
both: the analysis is repeatable, the gaps are visible, and every claim
ties to a specific tell.

## How It Works

The skill operates on three layers:

1. **The data itself** — biases inside the underlying study, paper, or
   dataset (funding, sampling, instrument design, demand
   characteristics, self-report distance from behavior, causal
   inflation, missing benchmark, publication availability)
2. **The source organization** — who paid for or produced the work,
   what they sell, what conclusion would be inconvenient
3. **The journalism on top** — what the reporter/commentator added:
   headline-to-source distortion, frame escalation, echo-chain
   amplification, causal claims layered over correlational data

Output cleanly separates **what the data actually supports** from
**what was editorialized on top**. Confidence is anchored to specifics
— no vibes-based "this seems biased."

## Routing

| Kind | Name | Trigger | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| Skill | **Check** | "bias check", "analyze bias on", "check this study/source/article" | `Skills/Check.md` |

**Check** is a Skill: it runs the full three-layer audit end to end on
its own, from fetching the source through the supported-vs-editorialized
split, with nothing else needing to run first. `Workflows/` is empty by
design — this agent has no cumulative procedure that sequences other
Skills or owns an approval gate.

## Quick Reference

- **Input:** one argument — URL, file path, raw text, or any
  combination.
- **Always tries to find the primary source.** If the input is
  journalism citing a study, the skill fetches the study itself, not
  just the article. If the primary source can't be located, that's a
  finding.
- **Three-layer output** — never collapse layers; the distortion
  usually lives in the layer the source is least transparent about.
- **Hard separation between supported and editorialized** — this is
  the deliverable shape.
- **Bias taxonomy reference:** `References/BiasTaxonomy.md` (load on
  demand for the full category catalog with definitions and tells).

## Examples

**Example 1: Article citing a vendor study**
```
User: "bias check https://futurism.com/some-article-citing-a-mercer-survey"
→ Invokes Check
→ Fetches the article, identifies the cited Mercer study, fetches Mercer's source
→ Runs three-layer audit: vendor conflict-of-interest, sample/question-design biases, journalism's headline-vs-source swap
→ Returns structured bias report + supported-vs-editorialized split
```

**Example 2: Raw paste of a study abstract**
```
User: "bias check this abstract: [pastes 4 paragraphs from a paper]"
→ Invokes Check
→ Skips Layer 3 (no journalism on top — input IS the primary source)
→ Audits Layers 1 + 2 only: funding disclosure, sample, methodology, conflict-of-interest
→ Notes if abstract is insufficient to assess methodology (publication availability bias)
```

**Example 3: File path**
```
User: "bias check ~/Downloads/some-report.pdf"
→ Invokes Check
→ Reads file
→ Identifies if report cites further upstream sources; fetches what it can
→ Three-layer audit with specifics
```

## Output Requirements

- **Format:** Markdown with the fixed section structure defined in
  `Skills/Check.md`.
- **Length:** Scales with source complexity. A single-claim tweet gets
  ~200 words; a vendor-funded study + viral article gets 800–1500.
- **Tone:** Plain. Specific. No vibes. Every bias claim ties to a
  concrete tell — a quoted phrase, a sample-frame fact, a missing
  disclosure.
- **Must Include:** Methodology line (sample, dates, instrument
  availability), the three layers, the supported-vs-editorialized
  split, a one-paragraph bottom line, sources list with URLs.
- **Must Avoid:** Hedging ("could potentially be biased"). Diagnose or
  don't. The reader gets to disagree — but they should know what the
  analyst actually thinks.

## Boundaries

- **Always try to find the primary source.** The single biggest
  failure mode is analyzing an article without ever reaching the
  underlying study. If the input cites a study/report/paper/dataset,
  the skill MUST attempt to fetch it. Inability to locate the primary
  source is itself a finding (publication availability bias) and goes
  in the output.
- **An impossibly high consensus number is a tell about the question.**
  When a survey claims 95%+ agreement on a substantive question, that
  almost always means the question was a low-bar yes/no. Note it
  explicitly even when the instrument is hidden.
- **Vendor research is research; treat it that way.** Don't dismiss a
  Mercer/McKinsey/PwC/Gartner report because they sell consulting.
  Their funding bias is a multiplier on the analysis, not an automatic
  disqualifier. Specific finding > generic "vendor bias."
- **Don't conflate Layer 1 and Layer 3.** A bad headline doesn't make
  the underlying data bad. A flawed study doesn't make the journalism
  dishonest. Keep them separate even when both have problems.
- **Headlines travel; bodies don't.** Most readers see only the
  headline. A headline-to-source mismatch is the most consequential
  journalism bias and should always be flagged when present.
- **"Charitable reading" is required.** Before concluding the source is
  misleading, articulate what the data DOES support. This anchors the
  critique in specifics.
- **Don't go beyond the source you fetched.** No drive-by claims about
  Mercer's other reports if you only read one. No "they always do X" —
  stick to what's in the artifact.
- **Pure opinion piece with no data?** This skill is the wrong tool —
  redirect to a psychological author-analysis skill for a psychological
  author read. BiasCheck needs claims with empirical scaffolding.
- **Author background is out of scope.** This skill audits the source
  artifact, not the author's biography. If you need "who is this
  writer and what's their track record," use Research or a dedicated
  OSINT/entity-investigation skill.
